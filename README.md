# 💫 About Me:
I am currently working on projects in Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning. My focus is on building intelligent, real-world solutions using tools such as Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, and data-driven modeling techniques. I enjoy transforming complex data into meaningful insights and developing scalable models that solve practical problems.<br>I’m looking to collaborate on innovative AI/ML projects that create real-world impact, especially in areas like healthcare analytics, financial intelligence, automation systems, and smart decision-support tools. I’m particularly interested in working with teams that value research-driven development, ethical AI, and solving meaningful problems through technology.<br>I’m looking for guidance and collaboration in developing AI-powered systems that make technology more accessible and beneficial for people. This includes solutions in healthcare (predictive diagnostics, patient data analysis), finance (risk modeling, fraud detection), and intelligent automation that improve efficiency and decision-making. I’m always open to learning from experienced professionals and contributing to impactful tech initiatives.<br>Ask me about machine learning model development, deep learning frameworks, real-world AI applications, or how data can be transformed into intelligent systems. I’m always excited to discuss emerging technologies, innovative ideas, and practical implementations of AI.<br>I enjoy breaking down complex AI concepts into simple ideas and believe that the best technology is the one that genuinely helps people in their everyday lives.<br>
